Scientific Software Development in Python is a graduate course covering the
topics **software development, project management and scientific computing**. It
aims to provide participants with the necessary knowledge to develop
high-quality, reusable and efficient scientific software as part of a larger
team or on their own.

* Course plan

The course consists of two parts:
 1. Lecture series (2.5 ECTS):
    The lecture series will take part during autumn term 2020 (September - December) and
    cover the following topics.

    - Software development:
      - Project planning and management
      - Organizing collaboration
      - DevOps with Python and GitHub: Version control, continuous integration,
        testing
    - General programming principles:
      - Object oriented design
      - Computing models and architectures
    - The Python programming language
      - Python language basics
      - Standard library
      - Package management
      - Testing and documentation of python packages
    - Scientific computing:
      - Parallel and distributed programming
      - Out-of-core programming
      - Visualization
      - Distributed and cloud computing

 2. Programming project (5 ECTS): The project part of the course will consist of
    a programming project that participants will collaborate on in groups of at
    least two. Participants are encouraged to choose a their project according
    to their research interests. The project comprises three phases:
    - Planning phase: Participants will together define the scope and
      use cases for the project.
    - Implementation phase: Participants will work on implementing the project. There
      will be regular progress meeting and code reviews.
    - Final phase: Each participant will present her results and insights in a seminar.

 During the project there will be regular retrospectives to reflect on project 
 progress and lessons learned.

* Intended learning outcome      
  
  After the course, participants will be able to:
  - Write, package and deploy high-quality Python software
  - Know how and when to apply different computing techniques
  - Contribute to (open source) software projects
